mix-blend-mode is a CSS property that controls how an element’s content blends with the content behind it. It determines how colors mix when elements overlap.

Usage:

.element {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

Common Values:

normal (default) → No blending

multiply → Darkens the colors by multiplying the background and element colors

screen → Lightens the colors by inverting, multiplying, and inverting again

overlay → A mix of multiply and screen, depending on brightness

darken → Keeps the darker color of the background and element

lighten → Keeps the lighter color of the background and element

difference → Subtracts pixel values, creating high contrast effects

exclusion → Similar to difference, but with lower contrast

color-dodge → Brightens the background based on the element

color-burn → Darkens the background based on the element

hard-light / soft-light → Adjusts contrast and brightness dynamically

hue, saturation, color, luminosity → Adjusts based on color properties


Example:

Blending text with the background:

<div class="blend-text">Blended Text</div>

<style>
  .blend-text {
    font-size: 50px;
    color: white;
    mix-blend-mode: difference;
    background: black;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
