Crisis in JS!!!

So i had was using Vue CDN in a project so i decided to make my router in a separate JS file and export it into my main JS file.... it was going well until when i wanted to use firebase API in my project so i used te modular approach which is approach for the latest version of Firebase....(Modular approach involves the use of imports) so i appliee the import in my router js file because my Auth component was written in my router JS....until i discovered that you cannot import or export from the same JS file... i was thinking this wss some ES modules fallback or some form of skill issue from my end , until i went straight to stack overflow to see no results....i also went to dev.to but i saw no article based on it, i also pasted it om google search engine but to to avail, so i thought it write to brainstorm an idea that can make it work because i actually had to rewrite my router and put it in my main script(this looked like a very bad practice to me and my main script which was around 30lines+ became 200lines+, which is poor for code optimisation and neat code practices....
